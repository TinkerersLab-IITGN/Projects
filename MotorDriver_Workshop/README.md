# Motordriver Workshop
This folder contains the arduino codes used in the session.

We have used "Encoder.h" library to get the total pulse count from the encoder.
<br>
To install that library, go to [this repo](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder) and download it as a zip file.
<br>
In the Arduino IDE, go the Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library... and select the downloaded zip file.
